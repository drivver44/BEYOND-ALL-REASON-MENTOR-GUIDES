# Playing Air
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

## Fundamentals
- The most important skill for an air player to have is map awareness, seeing what's going on and figuring out how to benefit your team. Sometimes that means putting more production into fighters, other times more production into shurikens or transporting a commander somewhere to help. **For this reason, it's not advised for new players to go air, since you need to have a reasonable understanding of the battlefield**.
- The second most important job of an air player is gathering information, especially early on. Early game scouts can provide lots of useful information that can help your team adapt.

  This includes:
  - Which faction people will be mainly up against

  - Which factory those people have opened with
  - How greedy / defensible those players are
  - How far forward those opposing commanders are
  - Which opponent is in each spot
- Air players can also sell someone a transport *(usually bought with 2 wind turbines)* to move their commander further forward faster. On some maps, it's important to give some players very early transports to secure an important part of the map. On Nuclear Winter, for example, it's very common to transport the back bottom player to the hill for them to build a factory there while trying to also build a fighter quickly to prevent the enemy from shooting said transport down, or to take out an opposing transport

- Air players are of course in charge of building fighters for anti air defense, but ultimately, it's a flex position that can transition out if need be. *If there is no enemy air player and your team is losing to ground, there's no sense in building tons of fighters*

## Differences Coming from Ground

- Air is very Energy heavy compared to other units, so keep an eye on your E, it can drain faster than expected, so expect to need to build more energy.
- Air Constructors aren't terribly efficient, they take a lot longer to build and tons of E to make. It is common in higher levels for an air player to buy a bot con (or 2) from an ally (especially if you can buy an off-faction con), or trade a bot con for a transport.
- Early on, since air units cost a lot of build time, it's not advised to walk your commander to grab mexes and waste that valuable build power. Instead, buy/build a ground con to grab them, or use a transport to move your commander around and grab those mexes faster. It's important to not slow yourself down with a lot of travel time when a transport is so easily available.
- Usually air players play cortex since shurikens can be extremely valuable in stopping leaks/run-bys or aiding a push. The banshee, armada's counterpart, doesn't have the same utility. It's weak attack takes a while to  destroy units, but can survive some light anti-air with it's higher HP.

## Opening
If no one needs an early transport *(usually that's map dependent)*, it's up to you to decide how much you want to spend on air units and how much you spend towards economy, but it's almost always going to be better to buy a ground constructor (80-90 build power, 3450 built time) of some sort in order to more quickly build infrastructure over building an air constructor (60 build power) that takes much longer to build (7960 build time).

- If You suspect your opponent isn't going to open with very early bombers, you can greed for more economy, but this does put your team at risk of being scouted and/or bombed early.
- The more economic your opener, the more units you'll be able to have later, but do note, building wind turbines and converting the energy still takes time to pay off and will set you back in most cases *(depending on how storng the wind is)*. It's also not advised to build solar collectors to convert their energy to metal *(it takes nearly 10 minutes to pay off solar!!)*

- In terms of an actual air plant opening, players asking for transports usually takes precedence over anything else as their strategy can often involve "getting there first". The next priority should be to try to build a fighter or two to defend those allied transports. From there it's more up to you, but I would highly suggest at least one scout to survey the situation asap before enemy fighters appear. This is invaluable information for your team.
- Don't be afraid to try an early bomber, not all air players are paying a ton of attention that early on. If you scouted and saw a more economic opener from the opposing air (or just see a lack of fighters), 1 or 2 bombers can deal plenty of damage if they're able to take out a small section of winds or con turrets on multiple players. Be warned, however, bombers cost a lot.

## Timings
- There are specific windows of opportunities based on what your opposing air player is doing. The biggest window of opportunity is when they are transitioning into T2 economy. This timing is going to change slightly depending on the map and who your opponent is, but there is potential to do a big bombing run around that time, a little before/after T2 cons start coming out *(destroying the only techer's t2 lab as it's finishing is very powerful)*. To use this timing to your advantage usually means giving up early T2 to produce a few extra fighters and a lot of bombers to be able to strike at that time.

## Fighters
- Fighters are often the most efficient form of Anti-Air since they are cheap and can get anywhere on the map rather quickly
- It's also very important to keep tabs on your opponent's fighter count. Get valuable information with allies building radar and scout once and a while to see what they have. If at all possible, you want to know if they're putting money into fighters, bombers or economy.
- You want to spread out your fighters so that any intruding air unit can be shot down very quickly instead of waiting for fighters to get to it, when it may be too late
  - People usually order fighters to patrol near the border, but sometimes have them in clouds spread across the area
- Sometimes players rely solely on an air player to produce enough fighters to defend the team, so it can be rather important to produce enough to defend against the number of fighters you see AND potential bombers/gunships.
  - This is a big reason why it's important you know what you're doing in terms of building your economy before playing air.

- To engage enemy fighters, it's advised to use the `[Fight]` command so they actively engage the enemy instead of moving past them *(with move command)* or using the area attack command *(which orders them to all attack the same targets)*



## Transports
- While a unit is being transported, you can see the unit under it and you may see some of the unit's properties such as jamming. These properties do NOT transfer to the transport. It may be ill advised to think of it as a unit under a transport and instead a unit inside a transport that looks cooler if it was under it.
- Some small buildings can be transported by T1 such a LLTs and construction turrets. Some units/buildings can only be transported by a larger T2 transport.
- The "Transport Heavy" property some units have does NOT pertain to if it can be transported by a T1 transport, but instead, how much weight is added to the tranport *(thus slowing it down)*. So even though the construction turret is "heavy", it can be transported by a T1 transport.

## Bombers
If you've never done a bombing run before, it can feel quite alien, as the micro is quite different because of the floaty nature of how bombers move and the simple fact you can't just use a fight command or move command to get them properly shooting.
  
- The most important thing is to see and select your target ahead of time. You cannot wait for the bomber to be at the target as the bombs start dropping well before the bombers see and reach the target. Aircraft also generally have a very low ground LOS, so you cannot just drive them into an unknown territory and have them start shooting.
- Bombers drop bombs in a line, with each one doing significant AoE, so it's best not to use bombers near friendly troops or buildings and almost never to try and take out a raid or your allies may not like you much afterwards.

### The Bombing Run
- Bombing energy and build power is your best bet - Try not to go for high hp targets unless you know you have enough.
  - *An enemy without energy or build power is crippled until it's all rebuilt, which takes time. Trying to destroy a t2 lab requires a lot more bombers and can get rebuilt much quicker.*
###### <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f765b7b-5dd4-4a00-afbf-39ba7569c4a9" img align="center" width="200"> *(Don't do this, it's not worth it.)*

- Core T1 Bombers deal 112 AoE damage per bomb and drop 5 bombers per drop (560 total), more than enough to take out wind turbines, so it's better to spread out your bombs than to concentrate them on this kind of target.
  - *(Note: The AoE is large enough that each bomb will affect more than one wind turbine when they aren't spaced | con turrets will require 2 bombers)*

#### How?
1. Most importantly, check if a bombing run is going to be viable, don't just blindly bomb. Send in a scout to see how much AA there is. If you're able to get info on where juicy targets are, even better.
2. Prepare your bombers, 10-20 is a reasonable amount for an attack around when players start transitioning into T2.
3. If you're defending your bombers with fighters, you want your fighters to absorb damage and defend the bombers
   - *(You want fighters to be between the AA and the bombers or to go in directly before the bombers - not too early, not too late)*
5. Gather your bombers together into the formation you want without revealing your bombers. You can circle around in allied territory a bit to line them up how you want.
  - Bombers should be together, but in a loose cluster
  - Having bombers too close together means AA can more easily deal extra AoE damage
  - Having bombers too far apart gives AA more time to shoot and focus on individual targets
4. Have scouts with the bombers and scouts to survey immediately before the bombers
  - *(have some scouts guard the bombers, and make sure you don't accidently give them an order, this is important to provide vision in case you weren't able to get info beforehand)*
  - Ideally enough to run past some of the AA to find good targets. You can even have some scouts pull in immediately before the bombers
5. As your bombers drop bombs, usually you want them to keep momentum and press forward, not sit on one target. If you're against multiple players, it's wise to move onto another player after each drop.

### Setting Up Targets
- If you're newer to doing bombing runs, I suggest using [`A + RMB`] to draw a line of spread out bombs across fields of energy production. This is the least apm intensive way of bombing
- If you have higher APM / you're used to doing bombings, you can make your bombings more successful if you spread them out manually and not drop extra bombs where they don't need to be.
  - 1 bomber is enough per line of wind turbines
  - 2 bombers is enough for con turrets
  - Small handful of bombers is enough for geos

- You want to set up the targets ahead of time if possible. Make note of your attack route, the bombs will drop in a line from that direction.

*(This is durring the bombing while setting targets up manually)* *(NOTE: **All** wind turbines and con turrets are destroyed after this picture)*

NOTE: In the above picture, extra bombers were sent to the con turrets in case some of them were shot down. Con turrets are the highest priority since they allow someone to build back up rather quickly.


# Defending Against Bombers

## Spread Your Buildings
- Spread out things like wind turbines and con turrets. The more spread out the better, but 2 spaces is usually enough.
- If you feel as though you need to space things together, try and do little clusters. This is especially helpful for con turrets - having small clusters instead of a giant row makes it much harder for any enemy *(ground or air)* to destroy all of your build power.

*(This is the aftermath of the above bombing - a lot less is destroyed than the above pictures)*

## Defending with Fighters
If you are the dedicated air player and people expect you to defend with fighters, here's what Important
- See it coming asap, this is why it's very important front players have radar to see further
- Send your fighters to attack the bombers, not the enemy fighters who can't deal any ground damage
- Feel free to use [`set target`] on bombers

## Defending with Ground Anti-Air
- Ideally, you want AA with lower range to be IN FRONT of your base. Putting them in your base can often mean they don't actually attack until the bombers are already dropping bombs
- Flak trucks are also strong AA
### Static Flak vs Long Range Anti-Air
  - Flak is significantly cheaper and more valuable when placed well, but having long range AA complement them means you can take out clusters of bombers or fighters before they even get to the flak.
  - Also, since they are long range, you can spread them out further and put them in your base.


# Finally, Air Positions are also Flex Positions
- Playing Air isn't solely limited to the "air player". Any backline position can safely build air. Even frontline positions can supplement air if they know what they're doing.
- Having one player match the other team's air player and a second air player to make bombers is a good strategy. When played well, the combination can overwhelm a lot of anti-air defenses.
- If your team's in danger and there isn't a lot of enemy air, you can also build a ground force to help stabilize your allies or bulk up an attack, though usually shurikens are enough help.
