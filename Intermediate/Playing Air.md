# Playing Air
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

## Fundementals
- The most important skill for an air player to have is map awareness, seeing what's going on and figuring out how to benefit your team. Sometimes that means putting more production into fighters, other times more production into shurikens or transporting a commander somewhere to help. For this reason, it's not advised for new players to go air, since you need to have a reasonable understanding of the battlefield.
- The second most important job of an air player is gathering information, especially early on. Early game scouts can provide lots of useful information that can help your team adapt. 

  This includes:
  - Which faction people will be mainly up against
  - Which factory those people have opened with
  - How greedy / defensible those players are
  - How far forward those opposing commanders are
  - Which opponent is in each spot
- Air players can also sell someone a transport *(usually bought with 2 wind turbines)* to move their commander further forward faster. On some maps , it's important to give some players very early transports to secure an important part of the map. On Nuclear Winter, for example, it's very common to transport the back bottom player to the hill for them to build a factory there while trying to also build a fighter quickly to prevent the enemy from shooting said transport down, or to take out an opposing transport
- Air players are of course in charge of building fighters for anti air defense, but ultimately, it's a flex position that can transition out if need be. *If there is no enemy air player and your team is losing to ground, there's no sense in building tons of fighters*

## Differences Coming from Ground

- Air is very E heavy compared to other units, so keep an eye on your E, it can drain faster than expected, so expect to need to build more energy.
- Air Constructors aren't terribly efficient, they take a lot longer to build and tons of E to make. It is common in higher levels for an air player to either start with a bot lab for bot cons, or buy a bot con from an ally (especially if you can buy an off-faction con), or trade a bot con for a transport.
- Early on, since air units cost a lot of build time, it's not advised to walk your commander to grab mexes and waste that valuable build power. Instead, buy/build a ground con to grab them, or use a transport to move your commander around and grab those mexes faster. It's important to not slow yourself down with a lot of travel time when a transport is so easily available.
- Usually air players play cortex since shurikens can be extremely valuable in stopping leaks/run-bys or aiding a push. The banshee, armada's counterpart, doesn't have the same utility. It takes a while to slowly kill any leaks.

## Ways to Open
- If no one needs an early transport (usually map dependant), air players can actually fairly safely open as if they were doing a fast tech opener to start with a few con bots to build up a small economy before transitioning into air. The benefit here is having those cons for more economic growth in the very early game but sacrifices having any air units out before then.
- In terms of an actual air plant opening, players asking for transports usually takes precedence over anything else as their strategy can often involve "getting there first". The next priority should be to try to build a fighter or two to defend those allied transports. From there it's more up to you, but I would highly suggest at least one scout to survey the situation asap before too many enemy fighters appear.
- Don't be afraid to try an early bomber, not all air players are paying a ton of attention that early on. If you scouted and saw a more economic opener from the opposing air (or just see a lack of very fighters), 1 or 2 bombers can be a big difference if they're able to take out a small section of winds on multiple players.

## Timings
- There are specific windows of opportunities based on what your opposing air player is doing. The biggest window of opportunity is when they are transitioning into T2 economy. This timing is going to change slightly depending on the map and who your opponent is, but there is potential to do a big bombing run around that time, a little after when T2 cons start coming out. To use this timing to your advantage usually means giving up early T2 to produce a few extra fighters and a lot of bombers to be able to strike at that time.

## Bombers
If you've never done a bombing run before, it can feel quite alien, as the micro is quite different because of the floaty nature of how bombers move and the simple fact you can't just use a fight command or move command to get them properly shooting.
  
- The most important thing is to see and select your target ahead of time. You cannot wait for the bomber to be at the target as the bombs start dropping well before the bombers reach the target. Aircraft also generally have a very low ground LOS, so you cannot just drive them into an unknown territory and have them start shooting.
- Bombers drop bombs in a line, with each one doing significant AoE, so it's best not to use bombers near friendly troops or buildings and almost never to try and take out a raid or your allies may not like you much afterwards.

### The Bombing Run

## Fighters

## Transports
- While a unit is being transported, you can see the unit under it and you may see some of the unit's properties such as jamming. These properties do NOT transfer to the transport. It may be ill advised to think of it as a unit under a transport and instead a unit inside a transport that looks cooler if it was under it.
- Some small buildings can be transported by T1 such a LLTs and construction turrets. Some buildings can only be transported by a larger T2 transport.
- The "Transport Heavy" property some units have does NOT pertain to if it can be transported by a T1 transport, but instead, how much weight is added to the tranport *(thus slowing it down)*. So even though the construction turret is "heavy", it can be transported by a T1 transport.
