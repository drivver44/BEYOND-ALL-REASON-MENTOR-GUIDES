# The Economic Game Loop
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

_Having a strong economy means being able to scale it up in order to afford more things to fight your opponent(s) with. Building an economy in BAR isn't as simple as throwing down some buildings or building workers to mine resources with. Instead of gaining and losing resources in chunks, they are gained and lost per second which means balancing the flow is critical._ <br>

Balance and adaptation is key, and as such, requires constant attention until doing it well becomes second nature.
> - Without a proper economy, one cannot even begin to really play
<br>

### The economic Game Loop is a simple, 3 part checklist players can go through throughout a match to ensure their economy is balanced
> - By constantly monitoring your resources and adapting to your needs, many economic mistakes can be avoided.

<br><br>

## The Loop Consists of 3 Elements:

### 1) Build up your **Metal[M]** income whenever possible by building **Metal Extractors [mex]**

Metal should almost always be your limiting resource, and it's easier to store. As such, grabbing mex early is important, especially the mexes you start near
  > - _Always grab those starting mexes asap while making sure you don't run out of energy_ <br>
  > - _As the game goes on, this comes with the caveat that you need to have enough units to defend your expansions_
<br>

### 2) Add on **Energy [E]** as you build more mexes so that you have energy to spend that metal - You NEVER want to run out
Running out of E is bad because it not only stalls production, but turns off metal extractors and some utility buildings and prevents some weapons from firing!
  > - _The type of energy you build is important too. Solar collectors cost heaps of metal, but no energy, while wind turbines cost little metal and some energy, but wind speed is dynamic. There are times to build solar and times to build wind, but we'll talk about that later. For now, you want to build mostly wind on most maps_
  > - _Ideally, you don't want to overspend on energy either, but I wouldn't worry about that right now either - the much more common issue is not building enough_
<br>

### 3) Whenever your metal starts going up and you have sufficient energy, add on small bits of **Build Power [bp]** to assist your factory
Build power is basically the rate of how fast you can use your resources. By having more build power assisting something, you are pumping more resources/sec into it to produce it faster.
  > - _Factories only have 100 bp, so it's important to assist them_
  > - _Bp can come in the form of more constructors, or more cost efficient construction turrets_<br>
  > - _At the start of the game, your commander is your primary source of bp_
  > - _Constructors are a great way to add build power early, since they can also help build up the base as necessary_
  > - _As the game progresses, construction turrets become more important since they are much more efficient_
<br>

### This is just a simplifed checklist to help you balance your economy 
- The most important bit if your new is to keep your metal low and energy up. Keep a keen eye on it throughout the match.
- While you get used to it, check your resources often and try to balance it. It may seem like a lot to constantly check at first, but after a while it'll become second nature

### This of course isn't the full picture of BAR either, or even the full picture of the BAR economy

This is a good starting structure if you're new or having trouble balancing your economy

There is, of course, much more to be said, but we'll leave it here for now
