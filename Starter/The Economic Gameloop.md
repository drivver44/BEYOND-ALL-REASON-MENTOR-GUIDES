# The Economic Gameloop
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

### The Economic Gameloop is the general economic fundemental backbone
This should be focused on first before anything else, oftentimes other issues can stem from an improper economy

<br><br>

## The Loop:

### 1) Build up your **Metal[M]** income whenever possible by building **Metal Extractors [mex]**

Metal should almost always be your limiting factor for building, as such, grabbing mex early is important, especially the mexes you start near
  > - *(so always grab those asap while making sure you don't stall on energy)* <br>
  > - *(This comes with the caveat that you need to have enough units to defend and make sure you have enough energy to pump that metal out of the ground and for units to shoot with)*
<br>

### 2) Add on **Energy [E]** as you build more mexes so that you have energy to spend that metal - You NEVER want to run out
Running out of E is bad because it not only slows down production, but also turns off critical infrastructure
  > - *(Mexes and some weapons require energy to function)*
  > - *(Ideally not over spending on energy either, but I wouldn't worry about that right now - the much more common issue is not building enough)*
<br>

### 3) If your metal starts going up and you have sufficient energy, add on small bits of **Build Power [bp]** to assist your factory
  > - *(At first this should be your commander alternating between assisting the factory and building E when you run low in order to work up a few constructors to help grab mexes, build energy and assist the factory. While making those constructors, you may want some fighting units too, so the timing will vary) (The number of fighting units you want should differ between maps, more on that later)*
  > - *(After enough constructors to do that, or if your metal is starting to running out is a good time to move the commander forward - this will differ depending on how many units you build with your constructors and how important controlling the space between you and your opponent is [what stuff is there in the middle to fight for, and how important is it?])*

#### *(This can be accelerated or decelerated depending on how aggressive you wish to be on any given map)*
