# Understanding the Terrain
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

In BAR, different units can traverse the terrain differently and different types of terrain lends itself to very different strategies and/or unit compositions.

If you are unfamiliar with a map, it is highly suggested to make note of various features so you can decide on how you wish to play on it

## Things to Look For that could alter your strategy

### The Terrain Itself
- **Small vs large maps**
	- Small maps lend themselves to faster rushes where units can reach an enemy base quickly, while larger maps lend themselves to slightly more macro oriented play, opening with more constructors. 
- **Flat vs hilly or bumpy terrain**
  - Flat Terrain lends itself to vehicles, who struggle the most to drive on an incline. If the map is bumpy or has a lot of verticality, it may be more suited for bots.
  - Some hills are not passable with vehicles. There is a special overlay to help you figure this out (toggled with F2 on default keys or F6 on grid)
- **Open vs Chokey terrain**
	- Some units are faster/slower than others. If the section of the map you'll be playing on is rather open, it lends itself to faster units who can more easily run around slower units, given all the open space. Slower units are generally more suited for closed off spaces where your opponents can't run around you as easily.

### Traversability
- **Impassible mountains**
	- Many cliffs are just not passible by your typical vehicle or bot, but fear not, there are also special all terrain spider bots that can traverse any cliff. These units are especially useful when your opponent is relying on mountainous terrain to defend themselves - you can just go over the cliffs, around your opponent's defensive position
- **Deep vs Shallow vs Waters**
	- You can find the elevation of terrain by hovering your mouse over a spot (*While having nothing selected*). This is useful to determine how deep the water is (*When a map has water, the water always starts at an elevation of 0*)
	- Vehicles and bots cannot traverse water deeper than 22, **ticks will not go in water deeper than 5 dpeth**
	- Many units cannot attack in water around 18 deep (*This depends on if the unit's weapon is submerged - it's not a fixed value*)
	- Larger ships (*bigger T2 ships*) and submarines can only traverse water at least 16 deep
- **Amphibious Units**
	- Some units are labeled amphibious (AA bots, certain tanks) and can traverse (*but not shoot out of*) deeper water. They have a slightly easier time traversing steeper terrain (*mostly to allow them to exit the water*)
  - *The Duck is the only underwater land unit that can shoot while fully submerged*
  - *Platypus can also attack in water, but they sit on top of it*

### Resource Allocation

- **Metal Disparity**
	- Some maps feature more metal spots than others. Take note of where the metal is, some maps feature a higher percentage of metal in the middle of the map. In those cases, it can be important to stake claim of the area sooner than later.
- **Metal Content**
	- Not all metal nodes are created equal. Some maps (*such as rosetta*) feature a +10 metal spot! Sometimes a node produces less than +1. Oftentimes these spots are towards the center of the map to instigate conflict. In that case, it may be important to try to get there before your opponent 
- **Reclaim**
	- Some maps feature rocks or metal wrecks that can be reclaimed for some extra metal, or trees/shrubs/crystals that can be reclaimed for some extra energy. (*Some maps have crystals that have both metal and energy*) - Be on the lookout
  - Maps with notable amounts of reclaim lend themselves to rez bot openers.
  - Rez bots eating trees can jumpstart your E production in the early game
  - In some cases, rocks can be found in the middle of the map and it can be important to try to deny your opponent(s) from gaining that metal. *Remember, every 100 metal you gain from the rocks also denies your opponents 100 metal, so it's actually a 200 metal difference!
- **Wind Strength**
	- Wind is the most dynamic resource and varies greatly. Making note of the minimum/average/maximum should alter how much wind to solar you get. On some maps it's down right foolish to get solar, while on other maps, you may want a mixture. Some maps have extremely low wind and solar is your only option.
- **Tidal Power**
	- Tidal power is almost always better than solar (*breaking even around 12 tide power*). On many maps, wind is ultimately still better given the average wind speed, but with tide, you don't have to worry about its inconsistent nature.
