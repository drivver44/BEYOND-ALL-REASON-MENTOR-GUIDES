# Putting it All Together
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

#### There are three checklists that can help you put some of this basic info together

<br>

## (1) The Constant Checklist

This checklist is a list of things to constantly monitor as the game moves on. If you ever find yourself unsure of what you should be doing, it should be going through this list. Doing so can help you remember what you should be doing.

### 1) **Balance Your Resources - check this often!**

- This is absolutely **THE most important** thing you should be doing. If your economy is imbalanced, then you aren't able to spend your resources adequately.
- Metal should always be your limiting factor. If it's energy, add on energy production asap to restore order. Sometimes I see players do this late, then try to fix it by adding on a little energy when they need a lot quickly.
- If your metal starts to rise while you have enough energy, then add on build power (usually construction turrets) to assist with factory production / building up your base.
- Many players idly build tons of extra energy, which is *ok* if they know they'll need it for T2. Ideally, however, it's going to be better to build just what you need, when you need it. (With exception to extra high wind maps, when converting it isn't going to take several minutes to pay off).
- Ideally, metal should be slowly draining and energy should be just slightly more than you need. It's easy to over make build power

### 2) **Check the Minimap / Zoom Out**
- Seeing bombers or raids early can be critical to you or your team's survival.
- Always ping to alert your allies asap so they have a heads up. A few seconds can mean a quick guard tower or AA defense.

 
### 3) **Check Your Units/Lane**
- Are your units idly dying to an artillery? Did your opponent poke/push you while you were checking your base?
- Take a look at what units they have and decide what you want to do about it - do you want to push? defend and tech? If you don't have direct vision, perhaps send a scout in and see?
- Even if you cannot see your opponent's units directly, you should have a forward radar to see if those dots are accumulating. Maybe they don't have a lot and they may be teching, is it time to push? Or maybe the dots keep adding up and you need more to defend with.

### 4) **Check Idle Constructors / Rezbots / Commander**
- Commanders should almost never be idle early on - Grab more metal extractors, assist nearby construction, repair damaged units on the front, ect
- Constructors at base can be told to assist your factory when their jobs are completed to help you spend that metal
  - Constructors/Rezbots near the frontline can assist with repairing your/allied units (for free mind you)

### 5) **Look for contested Reclaim**
- Reclaiming metal can easily turn the tide of battle, but oftentimes it's in the dead zone between you and your opponent. Is there potential for you to push and start reclaiming it?

### 6) **Check Your Surroundings**
- Take a look at not only your lane opponent's units, but the adjacent enemies/allies and see what they're up to and how they're doing.
- Maybe you can spare a few units to your ally or a few moments and aid in that fight instead of pushing into a bunch of defenses. This can be a big deal and a little bit of help can turn a losing fight into a winning fight or a winning fight into a 'The game's now over' situation

## (2) The Learning Priority Checklist

This checklist is meant to help with understanding where your focus should be as you learn the game. It is more or less a priority checklist. Try and get a strong grasp of each of these principles before moving onto the next.

### 1) **Understand the basic fundementals / mechanics**
- Understanding the base mechanics of the game is crucial, for if you do not know which keys do what or how reclaim works, how can you play well?
- Understand how to use the draw and drag mechanics, inserting things into your queue, repeat command, autogroups...ect.
- Understand how resources drain and gain per second, and get a feel for how they drain building common units/structures.
- Playing vs AI is a great way to learn the fundementals of the game

### 2) **Understand the differences between the factions and know what units are good against what**
- Understand the utility of different units. Some are better vs slow or non-moving targets, some are good for quickly responding to threats, some are good for directly engageing.
- Unit balance in BAR isn't as much about "This unit Counters this unit", but instead, "This unit is better at dealing with this situation".


	> *I can tell you artillery is weak against pawns running up to them, but that's only part of the story. What if I told those artillery are defended by a mess of Light Laser Towers?*

	> *I can also tell you centurions deal well with grunts, but what happens when those grunts avoid those centurions and go straight into your base?*

### 3) **Work on your opener, adapt to the map and situational changes, every game is different**
- Adjust your opener based on the map, playing different maps helps you become more versatile
- Take a look at the [Pre-Game Checklist](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Basics/9%20Putting%20It%20All%20Together.md#2-pre-game-checklist)

### 4) **Work on Controlling space and Expanding your Economy**
- Create long queued orders for builders to build metal extractors, energy production 
- Send Commander forward and Constructors out to expand metal production, building radar before moving into unknown territory and defenses the further away you get. [More info in this guide](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Basics/2%20Controlling%20Space.md)
- As you grab more metal, try to balance your Energy and Build Power accordingly, more info [in this guide](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Starter/Economy%20Fundementals.md#balancing-economy-is-first-step-to-victory)

### 5) **Work on Unit Control, try to fight often without losing much**
- Pay attention to your units, you don't want them staring into space while they die, perhaps you can catch your oponent's units staring into space instead, or catch one slightly out of position
- Maybe your opponent has all their units in one spot and you can simply run around them - there is a lot of potential if you have radar and can see where your opponent's units are

## (3) Pre-Game Checklist

This checklist contains things you should think about before your commander is beamed down, when the game is loaded in, but not started yet. It comes in two parts, one to servey the map's terrain, and two, formulating an opener.

### __A. Take a look at the map's features__

#### 1) **Check where the Metal is**
- Is there a lot of metal?
- Are there bigger nodes than others?
- Is a larger percent of metal in the middle of the map?
	  
#### 2) **Is the distance to your opponent long or short?**
   
#### 3) **Is the area you need to defend wide open or narrow?**
   
#### 4) **Is there a lot of Metal or Energy reclaim? Metal in rocks/crystals? Is it in more Contested Space?**
   
#### 5) **What is the wind speed like? Tide?**

More Details about the terrain can be found here: [Understanding the Terrain](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Basics/5%20Understanding%20the%20Terrain.md)

### B. Put Together an Opener

Your opener should always be based on the map features, where you spawn, and who/where your allies spawn

#### 1) Claim Mex Nodes asap
- Resources accumulate as you're building other structures and since metal is usually the limiting factor, it's important to try and build those up sooner than later
- Ideally place your commander in between metal nodes so the commander doesn't have to spend time walking to them
#### 2) Plan Out Your Energy
- As you claim the metal nodes near your commander, watch over your energy
- If you plan to build a solar, you can let it deplete first, as solars do not cost energy
- If you're planning to build wind, do it before your energy runs out, since they do cost energy
#### 3) Look for Reclaim
- If there is reclaim to fight over in contested areas, or you plan to rely on Energy reclaim early, you may want a bot lab sooner than later to build a rez bot and some faster/cheaper units to defend them
#### 4) Consider Your Base Layout 
- Having a layout that allows for smooth unit pathing can make a sizable difference
- More info here: [Base Layout Guide](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Basics/3%20Base%20Layout.md)

More Details about Openers can be found here as well: [Common Openers](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Basics/1%20Common%20Openers.md)

**Doing these things before the game even starts will help you avoid making a lot of common mistakes and help you develop a sense of good ways to play even if you are new to a map.**
