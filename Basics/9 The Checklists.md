# The Checklists
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

Personally, I think it's helpful to chunk up this information into broad categories, and when someone needs help, they can dive into a particular category more thoroughly, based on what kind of help they need.

For that reason, I like to break it down into a few checklists that can be easily referenced.

#### [The Learner Priority Checklist](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Basics/9.1%20The%20Learner%20Priority%20Checklist.md)
- This checklist is designed to be more or less a roadmap for learning the game, but should also serve as a checklist as you watch your own replays to determine what your biggest issues are
- For now, this checklist is limited to fundementals that many other concepts are based on

#### [The Pre-Game Checklist](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Basics/9.2%20The%20Pre-Game%20Checklist.md)
- This checklist is designed for anyone trying to understand how to play better or adjust their play on a particular map
- It is comprised of what to look for in determining how you wish to play with a link to a more detailed look

#### [The Constant Checklist](https://github.com/Zete0/Mentor-Guides/blob/main/Basics/9.3%20The%20Constant%20Checklist.md)
- This checklist is a list of priorities to think about during the game as you play if you are ever unsure of what you should be doing
