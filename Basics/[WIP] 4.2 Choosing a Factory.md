# How to Choose a Factory
<sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup>

## Not All Unit Types are Equal in Every Occasion

Each type of factory is strong in different ways and it's important to be able to tell the difference. Some maps are better for bots while some maps are better for vehicles.

## The tier 1 Factories, the Notable Differences


### Bots <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6babb1e0-dd1d-48a9-a29a-4a1dc17ee92f" width="50" height="50">

  - Costs are relatively higher in energy
  - Bots turn and accelerate quickly
  - Bots slow down slightly as they change elevation but can traverse steeper hills
  - T1 constructors have 80 build power (moderate build speed)


### Vehicles  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78cc2b66-6491-46e2-9c72-747dbb36d079" width="50" height="50">

  - Costs are relatively higher in metal
  - Vehicles turning too sharply loses their momentum and accelerate slowly
  - Vehicles slow down drastically as they change elevation and can't traverse some hills that bots can
  - T1 constructors have 90 build power (faster build speed)


### Aircraft <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0686505a-3a44-4f52-b30b-20ca263bba79" width="50" height="50">

  - Costs are relatively higher in energy and time
  - Some aircraft are **vtol** *(vertical take off & landing)* and turn/accelerate quickly while bombers/fighters turn/accelerate slower and need to keep flying forward
  - Aircraft can just fly over all terrain obstacles
  - T1 constructors only have 60 build power (slow build speed)


### Ships <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/953a48d3-5064-4921-bc70-7369a8fc7903" width="50" height="50">

  - Costs are relatively higher in metal and time
  - Ships turn and accelerate very slowly
  - Ships are bound to the water, large ships/subs cannot go in shallow water (they require at least ~16 depth)
  - T1 constructors have 125 build power


### Hovercraft Platform <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42bec24a-3f15-47c4-9126-f45209bf13d2" width="50" height="50">

  - Hovercraft costs are relatively higher in everything
  - Hovercraft turn and accelerate slowly
  - Hovercraft glide **over** water *(cannot be targeted by toprpedos/depth charges)* and can go over some steeper terrain
  - T1 constructors have 110 build power (very fast build speed)

# Making a Choice

- Your choice depends on what kind of terrain your on. 
- If you're playing a sea only position, you are limited to ships and hovercraft *(at least at the start, seaplanes platforms are available from a t1 construction ship)*.
- Aircraft weapons are generally weaker or harder to use against land units and not advised to open with first unless you're protected by an ally going ground.
- Hovercraft are extremely expensive for how strong they are and should only be used if assaulting a land enemy that can't be reached by land.

## For most cases, this leaves us with Bots or Vehicles

### Oftentimes this comes down to 3 Notable Map Differences
1. How big are the mexes / how easy is it to get energy?
2. How flat is the terrain?
3. Is there enough metal / energy reclaim to make a sizable difference?

## Bots <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6babb1e0-dd1d-48a9-a29a-4a1dc17ee92f" width="50" height="50">

- Bots perform better when the terrain has many steep hills or on bumpy terrain where vehicles would have to slow down often
- Since bots are cheaper on metal and higher on energy, it's easier to amass more of them when metal is harder to get and energy is easier to get
- Bots can use terrain features to run over mountains or hide in holes that vehicles can't get to
- Bots also have access to resbots *(ressurection bots)* that can very efficiently gather resources through reclaiming them *(look for rocks / trees)*,  can ressurect wrecks from the dead, and repair units very efficiently

### Some notable maps bots are a good choice
Look for maps with higher wind speed, such as forest maps.
- Heartbreak Hill, Ravaged, Wanderlust, Eye of Horus, Otago, Sunderance, Koom Valley (on hilly spawns)
## Vehicles <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78cc2b66-6491-46e2-9c72-747dbb36d079" width="50" height="50">

- Vehicles perform better when the terrain is very flat, where they can reach their max speed easily and plow through a location
- Since vehicles are cheaper on energy and more costly on metal, they are often a better choice when metal is easier to get and energy is harder to get
- Vehicles are generally a little stronger than bots, but can more easily get shut down by defenses stationed on a hill that's harder for them to reach
- Vehicles also don't have a resbot, but have the option of building an amphibious tank and an amphibious constructor for getting to places in the water or on land across some water

### Some notable maps bots are a good choice
Look for maps with very slow wind speed, such as moon maps.
- Comet Catcher Remake, Gecko Island, Flats and Forests, Moonshine Run, Starwatcher

### Final Notes:
In many cases, it's entirely viable to transition into a different tier 1 lab. You do _NOT_ need to stick to the same factory.
- Adapting to changes to the battlefield can be extremely strong.
- You can reclaim your starting factory and replace it with a different factory. *(reclaiming a living unit/building returns 100% of the metal cost)*
- IMPORTANT: In most cases, you cannot afford to produce efficiently out of multiple factories and should stick with one and add extra assisting build power to more effectively use it.
