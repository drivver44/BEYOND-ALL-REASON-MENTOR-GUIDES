# The Right Unit for the Job (T1)
<sup>(Author: NuttyWombat)</sup>

## Unit Classes
- **Scout Units**: Extremely Cheap, light, very fast, and large LoS. Great at very very early game harass before too many other units are out and getting information.
  - Ticks, Rovers, Rascals

- **Raiding Units**: Cheap, light, and fast units. Great at repositioning quickly to catch leaks, or leak themselves. Bad against LLT lines.
  - Pawns, Grunts, Blitz Tanks, Incisors

- **Skirmishing Units**: Units that are best engage at max range and distance.
  - Missile Trucks, Rocket Bots

- **Assault Units**: Tanky units that can take some damage while they engage. Benefit greatly from regular repairs.
  - Medium Tanks, Plasma Bots

- **Anti-Swarm Units**: Units with good Area of Effect damage and Impulse. Good against medium to large numbers of light units.
  - Janus, Centurion, Pounder

## Team Games
### Laning
- In team games, the laning phase of the game is mostly played using Skirmishing units, or Assault units.
  - In the case of Skirmishers, you want to engage at max range and minimize how much damage you're taking. In mirror matches, that can get a little tedious, moving forward and back while trading blows with enemy units.
  - To help skirmish, using something to establish Line of Sight helps significantly. That can be an aggressively placed Radar right behind your units, or a Scout (Rascal, Rover, Tick, Grunt) in the line with the the Rocket Bots.
  - Assault units you want to drive up, tank a bit of damage, kill higher value targets, and retreat to repair with Rez bots, Commander, or Both.

- Both unit classes are also susceptible to being swarmed and rushed. Players usually combat that by establishing a small LLT line that they can retreat to, positioning their Commander to support with Dguns, and adding in Anti-Swarm units with your assault units when you're still building up their numbers.

- Once LLT lines are drawn, Raiding Units don't have a lot of utility before you actually pierce a hole in the enemy's line with the other types of units. If you're anticipating a breach, you can switch to a flood of Grunts or Pawns to run through the gap and deal a lot of damage.
  - You want a few Raiders to help you get to mid quickly and secure your territory / protect your Cons, because the other units are much much slower, and harder to reposition and cover your expansion paths towards the mid point.
  - Try like 3 to 5 as a baseline for a narrow lane to cover, and scale up for maps that have wider fronts, going up to maybe 10 to 15 on something like Flats and Forests.
  - Scouts if you have them available also help act as spotters so that you can see what the enemy is producing and where they're sending them. Combined with Radars, you can maneuver your Raiding units to help secure your lane from leaks before your Commander can establish LLT lines.

## Duels
- There are several key differences between Team Games and 1v1s
  - The amount of territory you have to cover is much wider and is more dynamic (enemy can attack from multiple angles more easily).
  - This means you have many more mexes to capture.

- As such, mobility is *extremely* valuable. To efficiently expand and split the map, you often will have multiple Cons expanding in multiple different directions (typically 3 to 6 Cons out capturing mexes).
  - This makes *Scout Units* and *Raiding Units* much more effective than in team games, as LLT lines don't close off your attack paths as quickly.
  - By leapfrogging Radar towers to extend your vision into areas that you're expanding, you can see incoming attacks and reposition your Grunts / Incisors / Blitzes / Pawns to intercept enemy units.
  - By advancing along one path of attack (consider the map Tundra V2 as an example) with your Light units.
  - Deploy LLTs in chokes in order to prevent single Scouts and small forces from walking through for free.

- Due to how volatile and expensive teching can be in 1v1s, it is advisible to instead side-tech (build additional T1 labs) in order to spend your metal.
- Common transitions:
  - Grunts -> Incisors -> Brutes -> Air Support (Shuriken, Scout Planes, Transports, Cons for hard to reach mexes, Fighters to counter enemy air).
  - Incisors -> Brutes -> Forward Bot Lab producing Thugs -> Air Support.
  - Ticks -> Pawns -> Blitz Tanks -> Stouts -> Air.

- Among the T1 unit Roster, you will be hard pressed to find a unit as efficient as the Medium Tank.
  - Excellent speed, health, and damage output for the metal that you're spending.
  - Perfect unit to spend the large amount of metal you bring in as you secure your half of the map.
  - Having an answer prepared for this transition is important (Eg Shurikens, your own Medium Tanks, a mixture of Mediums and Anti-Swarm units).
  - How you answer / when you start producing your own Medium tanks can vary depending on how you plan to transition through the T1 labs (See previous point for examples).

- If you are preparing your 2nd T1 lab, consider what your opponent can transition into for their 2nd lab, and prepare accordingly.
  - For example, if you're switching from Bots to Bots + Air Support, you may want Shurikens to answer Medium Tanks.
  - If you're switching from Bots into Vehicles, you may want to add a few Anti Air turrets in your base to help protect against Bombers.
