# Scavengers Info
<sup><sup>(Author: kroIya)</sup></sup>

## Introduction
In the Scavengers gamemode, you are assaulted by relentless waves of seemingly mindless mechs.
Their designs are familiar, but their berserk programming allows them to sustain more damage before they shut down. There are rumors of bigger, deadlier machines in the depths of Scavenger ranks.
All Scavenger buildings continuously produce clouds of nanomachines, slowly reprogramming all units within and effectively marking their territory.
Hidden inside that territory, Spawn Beacons are using unknown technology to teleport in off-world reinforcements.
This technology is powered by Resource Generators, which can be stolen from Scavenger territory and converted to work for their new owner.
Lastly, if the Scavengers are unable to overcome the resistance present on the planet, a mech currently designated as the Scav Boss is sent to eradicate all opposition. No independent faction has ever survived to report on the encounter.

## Tips:
- Dead Scavenger units can be resurrected to fight on your side instead. Resurrecting units capable of construction unlocks designs developed by the Scavengers. Maybe they're not so mindless after all?
- The map contains Ruins left by a faction fleeing from the disaster. These can be Captured by your Commander or decoy commanders. All Scavenger constructors have access to this ability.
- Resource Generators will convert to whoever has more units nearby. They are occasionally teleported in by the Scavengers, or can be commonly left behind by a destroyed Spawn Beacon. Resource Generators can be transported by all air transports, so you may want to ferry them to a secure location before the Scavengers do the same.
- The Cloud converts any units inside to the Scavenger side, but the process is slow and can be stopped by destroying the buildings producing the Cloud. Beware, damaged units are more vulnerable to this method of capture.
- The Scavengers do not play fair, and can use artillery or hit and run tactics to wear out your defences. You may need to pursue them and deal with the threat in the open.
- Do not neglect anti-air and anti-nuke defences. Scavengers don't fire warning shots.
- Scavenger units are more durable than yours, but also more expensive to produce. In the case of some advanced designs, the extreme cost is only justified by ludicrous firepower.
- The Boss can adapt on the fly to mitigate the effectiveness of the units used against it. Having a diverse army is crucial for circumventing this ability.
- If you find the gamemode too difficult or too easy, you can change the difficulty preset in the Advanced Settings before you start the game.
